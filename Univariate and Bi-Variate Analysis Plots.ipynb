    "    * Line Plot(with markers) - *It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments.*\n",

    "    * Swarm plot - *The swarm-plot, similar to a strip-plot, provides a visualization technique for univariate data to view the spread of values in a continuous variable. The only difference between the strip-plot and the swarm-plot is that the swarm-plot spreads out the data points of the variable automatically to avoid overlap and hence provides a better visual overview of the data.*\n",

    "    * Histogram - *Histograms are similar to bar charts which display the counts or relative frequencies of values falling in different class intervals or ranges. A histogram displays the shape and spread of continuous sample data.*\n",
